# ArcxTurbine-Scratch

This is considered the full build and all the stuff is in order
Plus i included legacy so no one has to go get their own its already there.
It updates to quantum levels from there and then updates to blacksite levels and quasi levels from there.
This is essentially a world-build for a full space-station/loic-tokimac in minecraft and nothing else because its honestly not going anywhere for me. its a tribute for the crazy harassment and personal-friends and animal-buds that helped support me.
I dont really care this is just to test it out. Make it in gpt if you really want to spend the money because im too poor yadda yadda. Everything is written in this FAT FILE.

The legacy/the arc-1x super-distro (and i believe it can stand on its own once someone builds it the way i laid it out) its all consecutive to build.
the PROGRAMS that were used are more or less "jokes" that i would use them at all, infact i would just code this all in gpt if i could. but im too stupid. fact.
and secondly, uhmmm uhh...damn. Secondly....fuc...uh..mm..i truncated those programs so they dont need to repeat themselves per various installs, it all builds to a single operating system and those are real programs that i also dont really know how to use or what they are even for i just went and did that in my spare time. (i know on my pc its like 120gb and 60gb for all the docker crap.)---and TBH...i just installed a private server emulation and just pretend all this even is a thing that works for me to pretend I am gm in....using minecraft and playing that.
So its like a poorman's warcraft scenario with futuristic scify stuff for me and thats pretty good for me atm. Also i got a vrheadset that makes it so i just pretend im important.


i might have repeated some content just a little bit, considering i dont want to filter anything more out. I did also delete most of the ---what i consider offensive shit. oh well if it still is, some things are just that way. and by that i mean, i filtered out cusswords and weak attempts to be obscene and vulgar because of stuff i dont completely percieve just frustrated with, and to be honest i just am too introverted and learned to mind my own business and just vent to myself if its that bad, pro tip---a few times, its was awful and i wanted to just explode but that's life sometimes...not to mention i felt like a -literal keyboard slave- living on fumes for 90% of the thing, i was basically turning into a fucking zombie.
but i just perservere thru that shit and made it work. this was a nonstop project more or less a large portion of my day devoted to writing it out and stupidly building a mine-craft level based off it and my frustrations are more or less just a part of it because im not exactly a virtuoso genuis bastard with a golden intellect.
i managed to at least make some assets and that to me is a freaking accomplishment

im not kidding about the zombie mental-state---it was my only coping mechanism to HOW SUFFERABLE this was.

and also i wish i was, but uhh lol...hmm it is what it is. trying not to be a nuerotic oblivious idiot about this but its impossible.
so much that i feel uh..i can pretend this all more or less is some gentrified model based on all the programs and their size is roughly 200gb maybe 300 would be better but thats pretty much it.

this is "decent" enough to satiate my stupid ass for now (it started out i was using 5500xt and r5 and r7 processors with vulkan and upgraded them eventually to a 6600xt)---so my perspective has shifted a little from what i started out based off the computer build
So i just pretend I jury rig all this into my minecraft level and pretend i can vr it and that works i guess. i know its pathetic but also this has been just a massive cope for me that someone might make it come true.

i really want to just convert minecraft to a unity-based world with my minecraft-world-i-design into it so it looks real so maybe i feel better than just staring and LITERAL GOD DAMN BLOCKS lol and not taking this directly to MARS which i think would also be a dumb thing to do since i rather live minding my own business in my own -virtual-acre-land-house-
look dood, my brain is just destroyed im just trying to pass this info on to someone who can use whats left to be used here.

oh right...i specifically left out the brain because its personal and also not exactly anything that matters because the system should be able to "make one from scratched based off itself or its surroundings" when necessary...at least thats the idea (i had to DEVELOP it to a point the brain could be easily made too)---so thats something that is just more polished than the idea that i could "shove a book up in it to simulate an ai-personality" and have that somehow trustworthy at all. SO TECHNICALLY NOW, this is all good to go, if someone automatically makes this thing----it will create a fully furnished AI-SYSTEM with its own AGENT-trained to CURATE a WORLDBUILD all in ONECLICK.---but i guess at that point it doesnt matter then does it since someone can automatically make whatever they wanted....that's why this is what this is for---to really just provide a really intense sensible fringe-science thing to build instead of spend any time trying to start from scratch. LITERALLY---what a scratchfile is going to be used for. This is basically 'the arc1x scratchfile' if anyone gets it to WORK at all. Thanks.

Also the document itself is a bigger brain....just not necessarily a 'better' more human-esque brain with a balanced-etiquette (as the brain i developed in chivalry-arguments implies does)----and also....uhmm---the arch1x-scratchup being used as a brain would just make it more useful as a "production chain" than anything rather than a "deliberative-negotiation between parties" as is my chivalry-scratch-up. Ok....god im so freaking dumb, this is me just trying to get over this huge-bustling-bullshit-boof-ass-pound-excuse i wasted my time on, and i have true problems and apprehensions sharing it so im just going to leave it up as a good-gesture.
